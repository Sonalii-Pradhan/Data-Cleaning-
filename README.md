#     DATA CLEANING WITH MYSQL 

Erroneous, missing, or duplicate data in a dataset can be fixed or eliminated through the process of data cleaning. This crucial phase ensures that data analysis and decision-making are accurate and reliable.  

Procedure for data cleansing that will aid in data preparation: 

1- Eliminate redundant data 

2-Convert data types

4-Handle missing values 

5-Fix errors 

6-Handle errors

  ##              Why SQL? 

Programming languages like SQL (Structured Query Language) are used to administer and work with relational databases. In addition to its effectiveness in retrieving, filtering, updating, and deleting data, it also has applications for data cleansing jobs.  

With SQL, you can use a declarative approach, meaning you can tell the database engine what data you want and leave the rest to it, including how to obtain or edit it.  

SQL is hence an effective tool for data purification procedures.  

Most data pipelines need the use of SQL. When building a database on the cloud, SQL is considered  far more effective at cleaning data than scripting languages.
